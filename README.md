## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **Software Engineering student at the Tecnológico de Costa Rica (TEC)**, currently in my final year of the program. Throughout my academic journey, I have built a strong foundation in software development, applying best practices and design principles to create efficient, scalable, and maintainable solutions.

Over the years, I have worked with **multiple programming paradigms and architectures**, including the **Model–View–Controller (MVC)** pattern, using a variety of technologies and languages.

### 💻 Programming Languages
I have used several programming languages throughout my studies, including:

- **Python**
- **JavaScript**
- **TypeScript**
- **PHP**
- **Java**

### 🗄️ Databases & Data Technologies
I have hands-on experience with both **relational and non-relational databases**, such as:

- MySQL  
- SQL Server  
- MongoDB  
- Firebase  
- Elasticsearch  

I consider myself a **persistent, organized, and detail-oriented developer**. I do not stop until a problem is fully solved and the code meets the required specifications. I value **clean code, proper documentation, and structured workflows**, and I work effectively in both **collaborative team environments and independent settings**.

I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge, learn new technologies, and improve my skills as a software engineer.
